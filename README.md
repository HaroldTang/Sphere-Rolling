# Sphere Rolling Project
Interactive computer graphic project. Use OpenGL and shader programming in lighting, texture mapping, reflection, particle effect.
For this project, the sphere is imported from file and can start from one corner of the plane. 
- When click on the 'B' button on the keyboard, make the sphere rolling on the surface. 
- With the left mouse clicking, stop the sphere from rolling.
- With the right mouse menu options:
  - create the shadow effect of the sphere (based on homogeneous coordinate system - shadow matrix)
  - texture mapping on the sphere and the floor (use texture coordinate), also can click on keyboard 'U','A', 'V', 'T' to change the effect of mapping
  - lighting setting (point source, spotlight or distant light)
  - Change the solid sphere setting to get a linear sphere and a linear ground.
- Click on the 'L' button on the keyboard to create a lattice effect on the sphere. 

## Bresenham’s scan-conversion algorithm for a Circle
Use Bresenham’s scan-conversion algorithm to derive an algorithm for OpenGL to draw a circle, use value binding with idle() function to create a movement of circles.
